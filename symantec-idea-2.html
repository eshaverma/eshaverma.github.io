        SSL on Mobile
<br>
<ul>
<li>
        New Business: A mobile browser optimized product will allow a differentiated offering as compared to our current product in terms of better security, lesser processing time and smaller space requirement
</li>
        <li>
        For native apps, an app user has to be placing considerable trust on the app provider to have implemented SSL/TLS correctly with authentication, if at all. Hence, it is pretty risking sending private data from mobile apps in their current state, as itâ€™s unencrypted soons as it it gets outside the encryption and authentication of the 3G network, and far worse over Wifii. 

        </li>
        </ul>

         SSL on Internet of Things
<br>
<ul>
<li>
     New Business: As the first CA, we played a huge part in creating the SSL ecosystem. We can bring to IoT all the lessons learned in the past (almost) 20 years of practical PKI. The model that was built for user/web-site trust can also be applied to IoT systems in which millions or billions of devices, created by diverse vendors, need to securely connect to each other. It makes sense to leverage a small number of trusted CAs to build and manage trust among vendors.   
</li>
<li>
There are many appliance providers, especially smaller ones that will flood the market for IoT.  For these small companies, Symantec can look into providing not just SSL Certs but also a small hardware component that fits within these appliances, that provides network encryption functions. While thinking of SSL on smartphones, I realized my Raspberry Pi (a device comparable to  IoT devices) runs the same flavor of Debian as Android.  Hence, I predict that very little Java/C code establishing a SSL client and a keystores, can be put on a small, non-tamperable chip, and purchased off-the-shelf and installed on IoT devices as a part of the Trusted Computing Base.

</li>
</ul>

 SSL on Bluetooth
<br>
<ul>
<li>
Internet of Things add-on: SSL is commonly used over the net. However, over short ranges, I wanted to highlight that SSL can also be used over bluetooth. I have not tried this, but it appears that there are some opensource libraries, such as spongycastle, bouncycastle (we already use this one), and IOIO over bluetooth that can help make a SSL wrapper around a bluetooth socket.
</li>
</ul>

        Last known state?
        <ul>
        <li>
        
        Trust Services was looking into creating a browser offering, starting by focusing on the financial services, online retail and productivity apps. Their needs most closely match the potential advantages provided by such a product

        </li>
        <li>
        Symantec R&D is planning for leveraging and customizing root, private CAs and Trust Ecosystem, especially looking at Automotives. Magnum team is supporting the router project
</li>
</ul>
